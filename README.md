# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Bootsrap Portfolio Challenge - created using [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)

## Description
I previously learnt about creating a portfolio site using HTML and CSS, this week I used Bootstrap skills to create a similar page. Overall I found this to be a lot more efficient.

## Process

After looking through the requirements of the task i thought it was best to start off with a wireframe:

![Wireframe](images/Wireframe.png)

I created this so it would help me piece together what the requirements were and envision how to put this together. I could clearly see what Bootstrap Elements I would require and where I would need to consider css elements, grids, cards and links.


## Additional notes

Overall, I think I can and i will improve on this page over time, the basics are there and I have used a few placeholders in terms of images and links as well as a dummy phone number and email, but I'm excited to see this develop over time.
